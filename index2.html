        <h2>Normal HTML Elements vs. Semantic HTML Elements</h2>
        <p><strong>Normal HTML Elements:</strong> Think of them like basic building blocks. They're versatile but don't tell much about their purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>Semantic HTML Elements:</strong> These are descriptive, like labels on building blocks. They give a clearer picture of what's inside. For example, instead of just saying "block," you can label it as "header" or "footer."</p>

        <h2>Disparity between Closing Tags and Self-closing Tags</h2>
        <p><strong>Closing Tags:</strong> They're like the last piece in a puzzle, marking the end of something. For example, when you finish a paragraph, you need to say, "That's all for this paragraph" by using a closing tag like &lt;/p&gt;.</p>
        <p><strong>Self-closing Tags:</strong> These are for things that don't need an ending because they're self-contained, like an image or a line break. It's like saying "Here's an image" without needing to say "End of image" afterward.</p>

        <h2>Inline Elements vs. Block Elements</h2>
        <p><strong>Inline Elements:</strong> They're like words within a sentence, seamlessly fitting in without causing a break. They're great for small things like emphasizing a word or creating a link.</p>
        <p><strong>Block Elements:</strong> These are like big building blocks in a wall, each starting a new line and taking up the full width. They're perfect for creating distinct sections like paragraphs or headers.</p>
